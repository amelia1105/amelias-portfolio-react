# Amelia's Portfolio (React)

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

This project involves creating a portfolio that consists of an About Me section, a Portfolio section, a Resume section, and a Contact section. This portfolio was developed using React. As a future software developer, having a portfolio will not only help me standout among other candidates, but it will also help me connect with other developers in the community. Further, I will be able to provide concrete examples of my skills by simply directing employers to my website. I learned a lot while creating this project, like how React components interact with each other, how to modularize code, and how to integrate React component libraries into my code.

## Credits

Although no starter code was provided for this assignment, I used some files from other projects to get started. I initially created a Vite project and then used the source code from the 23-Ins_React-Router assignment to get my React component interactions and navigation tabs set up (in GitLab, [RUT-VIRT-FSF-PT-10-2024-U-LOLC](https://git.bootcampcontent.com/Rutgers-University/RUT-VIRT-FSF-PT-10-2024-U-LOLC) > 12-React > 01-Activities > 23-Ins_React-Router). I used React Bootstrap components, Bootstrap CSS, and React Icons throughout the project.

I was inspired by the design of another developer's portfolio, [Soumyajit Behera](https://soumyajit.vercel.app/), and used a similar color scheme in my project. All other code was developed by myself with the assistance of GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT.
